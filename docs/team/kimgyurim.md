## Contributions to the Project

### New Feature: Implemented a Unit Enumerator
- **What it does:** Standardizes measurement units for ingredients by introducing an **enumeration (enum)** for units such as grams (g), milliliters (ml), and pieces (pcs).
- **Justification:** Ensures consistency in unit handling across the application, preventing errors in ingredient tracking and calculations.
- **Highlights:** Required modifying multiple components, including command parsing, inventory storage, and stock adjustment logic, to incorporate unit conversions seamlessly.
- **Credits:** Inspired by best practices in software engineering for handling standardized units in inventory management.
