# Implementation of the Parser Feature

## Overview
The Parser feature is a crucial component of the application, responsible for interpreting and processing user input.
It serves as the bridge between the user interface and the underlying logic of the application, ensuring that commands are correctly understood and executed.

## Design and Implementation
The Parser feature is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new commands and functionalities. The core components of the Parser feature include:
1. **Command Classes**: Each command is represented by a separate class, which encapsulates the logic and parameters associated with that command. This design allows for clear separation of concerns and makes it easy to add new commands in the future.

2. **Parser Class**: The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing the user input and instantiating the appropriate command class. It uses a series of `switch` statements to determine the type of command based on the input string.

3. **Command Execution**: Once the command is parsed and instantiated, it is executed by calling the `execute` method on the command object. This method contains the logic for performing the action associated with the command.

4. **Error Handling**: The Parser feature includes error handling to manage invalid input and provide feedback to the user. If the input cannot be parsed or if the command is not recognized, an appropriate error message is displayed.

# Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, the `Parser`, and the `Command` classes during the execution of a command:

### Why It Is Implemented This Way
By using separate command classes, we can easily extend the functionality of the application without modifying the core parsing logic.
By encapsulating the command logic within individual classes, we adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

# Implementation of the Storage Feature

## Overview

The Storage feature is responsible for managing the persistence of data when the application exits. It handles the reading
and writing of data to and from `data.txt`, ensuring that user data is saved and can be retrieved when the application is relaunched

## Design and Implementation

The Storage feature is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new data types and functionalities. The core components of the Storage feature include:
1. **Storage Class**: The `Storage` class is responsible for managing the reading and writing of data to and from `data.txt`. It provides methods for loading data from the file and saving data back to the file.
2. **Data Classes**: The Storage feature interacts with various data classes, such as `IngredientInventory`, `ShoppingList`, `RecipeManager`, and `PlanPresets`. Each of these classes represents a specific type of data list and provides methods for manipulating that list.
3. **File Handling**: The Storage feature uses file handling techniques to read and write data to `data.txt`. It ensures that the data is formatted correctly and that any errors during file operations are handled gracefully.

# Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the `Storage` class and the other key lists in the application during the loading and saving of data:
The key lists include: `StockList`, `LowStockList`, `RecipeList`, `ShoppingList`

# Implementation of the Ingredient and Ingredient Inventory Features

## Ingredient Feature

### Overview
The Ingredient feature represents individual ingredients in the system. Each ingredient instance encapsulates essential
attributes such as name, quantity, and unit. This modular design ensures that ingredients can be easily created,
modified, and retrieved when needed.

### Design and Implementation
The Ingredient feature is designed for flexibility and accuracy, ensuring seamless interaction with other components
like the Ingredient Inventory and Recipe Manager. The core components of the Ingredient feature include:

- **Ingredient Class**: Represents an individual ingredient with attributes for name, quantity, and unit. It includes
- methods to get and set these attributes, ensuring proper data encapsulation.
- **Unit Feature**: Standardizes measurement units for ingredients, ensuring consistency.

### Core Functionalities
- **Creating Ingredient**: Allows creating ingredients with specified attributes.
- **Updating Ingredient**: Provides methods to modify an ingredientâ€™s name, quantity, and unit.
- **Unit Management**: Ensures valid unit selection and provides functionality for unit conversion.


## Ingredient Inventory Feature

### Overview
The Ingredient Inventory feature is responsible for managing a collection of ingredients, tracking their quantities, and
ensuring users can monitor their stock. This feature enables users to add, update, and remove ingredients while
supporting low-stock alerts.

### Design and Implementation
The Ingredient Inventory feature is modular and extensible, allowing for seamless integration with features like Recipe
Management and Shopping Lists. The core components of the Ingredient Inventory feature include:

- **Ingredient Inventory Class**: Manages the collection of ingredients, allowing users to add, update, and delete
- items.
- **Low-Stock Alert System**: Enables users to set and retrieve low-stock alerts, notifying them when ingredients fall
- below a set threshold.
- **Integration with Ingredient Feature**: Uses the Ingredient class to ensure consistency and modularity in ingredient
- representation.

### Core Functionalities
- **Adding and Managing Ingredients**: Users can add new ingredients with a name, quantity, and unit while ensuring
- valid input through validation checks.
- **Updating Ingredient Quantities**: The feature allows increasing or decreasing ingredient quantities.
- **Deleting Ingredients**: Users can remove ingredients from the inventory, ensuring accurate stock representation.
- **Low-Stock Alerts**: The system supports configurable alerts to notify users when ingredients are running low.

### Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, the Ingredient Inventory, and the
Ingredient feature during ingredient management:

![img_4.png](img_4.png)
### Why It Is Implemented This Way
The Ingredient and Ingredient Inventory features follow a modular design to ensure flexibility, scalability, and
maintainability. The Single Responsibility Principle is adhered to, with the Ingredient class managing individual
ingredient attributes (name, quantity, unit) and the Ingredient Inventory class handling the collection of ingredients.
This clear separation makes the system easy to understand, maintain, and modify without affecting other components.
